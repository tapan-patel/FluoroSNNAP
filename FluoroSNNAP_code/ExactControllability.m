function [Nd,drivernodes,Nconfigs,ld,C] = ExactControllability(A,varargin)
% Computes the exact controllability of matrix A of arbitrary structure. 
% Input: adjacency matrix A, where entry in row i, column j, indicates a
% connection from i to j. 
% Use second argument (..,'plotting',0) to disable generating network figure.
% Default is to plot.
% Returns Nd = number of driver nodes, drivernodes = list of driver node IDs, 
% Nconfigs = number of different configurations that satisfy the requirement of Nd. 
% Each time the code is run, a different set of configuration of driver nodes 
% will be returned. The total number of driver nodes remains constant.

% Examples 1, 2 and 3 are three different network configurations illustrated
% in Figure 1 of Liu et al, Controllability of complex networks, Nature
% 2011

% Example 1:
% Directed path, 4 nodes. Node 1 connects to node 2, node 2 connects to
% node 3, node 3 connects to node 4
% A = [0 1 0 0;
%      0 0 1 0;
%      0 0 0 1;
%      0 0 0 0];
% [Nd, drivernodes,Nconfig] = ExactControllability(A,'plotting',1);
% The above command returns Nd = 1, i.e. total of 1 driver node,
% drivernodes = 1, i.e. node #1 is the driver node
% Nconfig = 1, i.e. there is only 1 configuration of driver node

% Example 2:
% Directed star. 4 nodes, where node 1 connects to all other 3 nodes.
% A = [0 1 1 1;
%     0 0 0 0;
%     0 0 0 0;
%     0 0 0 0;];
% [Nd, drivernodes,Nconfig] = ExactControllability(A,'plotting',1);
% In this example, there are total of 3 driver nodes, Nd = 3.
% The identity of driver nodes are provided in the vector drivernodes.
% There are total of 3 distinct configurations of selecting drivernodes,
% Nconfig = 3. Each time the algorithm is run, a different set of
% drivernodes will be returned. The possibilites are: {1,3,4}, {1,2,3},
% {1,2,4}

% Example 3:
% A = [0 1 1 1 1 1;
%     0 0 0 0 0 0;
%     0 0 0 0 0 0;
%     0 0 0 0 0 0;
%     0 0 0 0 0 0;
%     0 0 0 0 1 0;];
% [Nd, drivernodes,Nconfig] = ExactControllability(A,'plotting',1);
% In this example, there are Nd = 4 driver nodes and 4 distinct
% configurations. The possiblities of drivernodes = {1,2,3,4}, {1,3,4,6},
% {1,2,3,6}, {1,2,4,6}

% Example 4:
% Let's try a more complex network. Let's build a scale-free directed
% network with 300 nodes, using a seed network size of 10 nodes and average
% connectivity 10. Please see the accompanying BAgraph_dir.m file for more
% info on the algorithm. The BAgraph_dir algorithm may take some time to
% generate an adjacency matrix. To save time, you may load a sample
% adjacency matrix by executing: load('scalefree_adjacency.mat');
% A = BAgraph_dir(300,10,10);
% A scale-free network should have a power-law degree distribution. Verify
% by 
% figure; hist(sum(A),20); xlabel('Degree'); ylabel('Count');
% [Nd, drivernodes,Nconfig] = ExactControllability(A,'plotting',1);
% There are Nd = 33 driver nodes and only 1 configuration. The identity of
% driver nodes is provided in the variable drivernodes.
% You will note that the drivernodes have very low in-degrees
% sum(A(:,drivernodes)

% Example 5:
% Lastly, let's try a random undirected symmetric Erdos Reyni network of 300 nodes with 0.01
% probability of connection between any pair-wise nodes
% A = erdos_reyni(300,0.01);
% [Nd, drivernodes,Nconfig] = ExactControllability(full(A),'plotting',1);
% There are Nd = 22 driver nodes and 16 different ways to choose 22 driver
% nodes. Note: as the network becomes less sparse, i.e. as the probability
% of connection incresease from 0.01, the number of driver nodes decreases.

% In Yuan's algorithm, a(i,j) refers to a connection from j to i rather than 
% a connection from i to j. So the input needs to be transposed.

% Multiplicity of an eigenvalue i is the number of times lambda_i is repeated 
% (tolerance 1e-8). lambda_i that corresponds to the maximum multiplicity is 
% then used to compute a geomtric multiplicity.
% C is the column reduced matrix whose dependent rows  are the identities of 
% the driver nodes. There can be more than 1 set of driver nodes consistent 
% with the requirement N_D total driver nodes.
