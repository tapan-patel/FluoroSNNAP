function zM = AAFTsur(xV,nsur)
% zM = AAFTsur(xV,nsur)
% AAFTsur: Amplitude Adjusted Fourier Transform Surrogates
% This function generates 'nsur' AAFT-surrogate time series and stores them 
% in the matrix 'zM' (columnwise). The AAFT surrogates are supposed to have 
% the same amplitude distribution (marginal cdf) and autocorrelation as the 
% given time series 'xV'. 
% The algorithm is according to 
% Theiler, J. et al (1992), "Testing for Nonlinearity in Time Series: 
% the Method of Surrogate Data", Physica D, Vol 58, 77-94.
% Refer also to the Appendix in 
% Theiler, J. et al (1992), "Using Surrogate Data to Detect Nonlinearity 
% in Time Series", in "Nonlinear Modeling and Forecasting", edited by
% Casdagli, M. and Eubank, S., Addison-Wesley, Reading, MA, 163-188.
% INPUT
% - xV  : the given time series
% - nsur: the number of surrogate time series (default is 1)
% OUTPUT
% - zM  : the n x nsur matrix of 'nsur' AAFT surrogate time series
