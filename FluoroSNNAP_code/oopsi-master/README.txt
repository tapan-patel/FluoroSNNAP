This is a repo containing the most current code for doing model-based spike train inference from calcium imaging.  Manuscripts explaining the theory and providing some results on simulated and real data are available from the fast-oopsi, smc-oopsi, and pop-oopsi github repositories.  Those repositories also contain code that you may run and data to download to play with things.  Any question, ask them in the issues tab.  Please let me know of any positive or negative experiences.  Much Obliged, jovo

Note that there are two python implementations of fast-oopsi (foopsi) that i expect to work better and faster:
https://github.com/liubenyuan/py-oopsi
and
https://github.com/alimuldal/PyFNND.
